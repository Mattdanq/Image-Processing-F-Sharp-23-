# Image-Processing-F-Sharp-23-
CS 341 Project in F#  
The file I adjusted was the Library.fs file  
This project was to practice with F# syntax in a short period of time using tail recursion and higher order programming in F#  
The project will prompt the user for several options that in-turn will make treat it as image processing functions in today's camera apps.
The program will soley create a .ppm file that has to be read through a .ppm reader.  
The images shown below is the images generated through the ppm file reader that was given to me.
